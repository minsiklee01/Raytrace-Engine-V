                    **Project 02: Raytrace**

This is a sample write up for the Project 02: Raytrace COS350 project.



<!--

General
========

Use this readme to describe what you learned while working on this project.
Also include any problems you ran into, solutions you found, fun things discovered, etc.
This document is your chance to communicate to me what you learned and to show off what you did.
Feel free to include code snippets if it helps.

You should include all the images that you code generated in here along with a short description.
I have added a few reference images (under `references/` folder), but you should delete those and add your own images (under `output/` folder).

Be sure to include a description of the elective(s) and creative artifact.

Hint: it might be good to write a short note on how you know your implementation is doing the correct thing.
For some of the images, this is obvious as you can compare your output with my reference images.
But for other images, it might not be so obvious.


Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

Take a look at the [Markdeep Feature Demo](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html) to see how you can markup this document.



Submission
-----------

Submit a zip with everything needed to run your project, which includes _ALL_ source code and any extra images.
I will run your submissions on my computer to make sure that all images are produced by your code.
I will read through your readme (this document) to understand how you implemented your source.

elective1: triangle

Implemented using the slide.

elective2: glass

Implemented using the slide.

creative artifact: ico sphere

![](references/blender.png)
![](output/P02_11_ico_sphere.png)

I created a very simple ico sphere in blender and used the coordinates of triangles to create my own in v.





Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!--
What bugs or limitations were troublesome?
What bugs or limitations still remain?
Are these bugs or limitations a problem in your implementation, algorithm, or something else?
How do you know that you did not miss a bug?
What additional tests did you run to ensure that your implementations are correct?
-->
Refraction is not perfect, it creates a black ring.


Reflection
===========

<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
How did you discuss the problem with others? (ex: white-board algorithms, looking over code for bugs, looking at print out results, etc.)
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
How much time did you spend writing new code, debugging code, thinking about the algorithms, discussing with someone else, running tests, writing comments and documentation, etc.?
List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.

This project was challenging but got a lot of help from a classmate and Dr.Denning. Piazza was a light in the darkness when I got stuck. 
Compared to writing the codes in v lang, understanding the concept of raytracing took most of the time.
The process was stressful but fun. I am very happy with what I have.
